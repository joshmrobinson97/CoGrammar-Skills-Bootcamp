animal = "Lion" # added quotation marks to make the variable a string
animal_type = "cub"
number_of_teeth = 16

full_spec = f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth" # added an f to make it an f string. Rearranged the variables for grammatical sense

print(full_spec) # added brackets () to the print command
